menuconfig CONFIG_DEV_URANDOM
	bool "Enable /dev/urandom"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable support for /dev/urandom provided by either a hardware TRNG or
		by a software PRNG implementation.

		NOTE:  This option may not be cryptographially secure and should not
		be enabled if you are concerned about cyptographically secure
		pseudo-random numbers (CPRNG) and do not know the characteristics
		of the software PRNG implementation!

choice
	prompt "/dev/urandom algorithm"
	default CONFIG_DEV_URANDOM_CONGRUENTIAL

config CONFIG_DEV_URANDOM_CONGRUENTIAL
	bool "Congruential"
	---help---
		Use the same congruential general used with srand().  This algorithm
		is computationally more intense and uses double precision floating
		point.  NOTE: Good randomness from the congruential generator also
		requires that you also select CONFIG_LIBC_RAND_ORDER > 2

		NOTE: Not cyptographically secure
