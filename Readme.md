<h1>Welcome :-)</h1> 

This is the repository for the Custom Firmware for the SF2000 from DataFrog. 

<h2>Project Status:</h2>
Currently we are in a very early stage. We found the SDK for the chip, and are currently preparing it to build an first booting firmeware. There is still A LOT of work to be done.<br> 
<h3>When will it be done?</h3>
Short answer: It will be done, when its done<br>
Slightly Longer Answer: At this point its nearly impossible to say how long this will take. Anywhere from a few months, to a few years I guess. 

<h2>FAQ:</h2>

- Do we need funding?
    - No. Check the Donation part of this readme for more details. 
- Does the Firmeware have a name? 
    - No, not yet. But we are collecting possible names, and will do a community pol once the project is mature enough

<h2>Project Members:</h2>

<b>Ignatz:</b> Maintainer of this repository, main dev on the SF2000 Custom Firmeware and Project Manager. Has ADHD, so might be unrelaiable at times, but allways has the best intent.
<br><b>Osaka:</b> A researcher of the original firmware, author of the bootloader fix and the sample custom code (BMP viewer)

<h2>Support: </h2>

If you want to help on the project, please contact Ignatz on the Retro Handheld Discord, in the data_frog_sf2000/SF2000 Dev Channel. He is the current maintainer of the project. You can also check the Issues board for the current progress and open tickets. But please sync with Ignatz first, before starting on something, so we can avoid that something might be done out of order, or double. Which would just waste effort.

<h2>Donations:</h2>

Please note that donations are not a guarantee for the project to continue, or to succeed. If you decide to donate anyway, we will be very greatfull about that.<br>
We also dont need any funding at the moment. We have the tools we need to work. We just need time. So Anything you might donate, will be just out of kidness, and might highten the sprit of the devs, but it will not increase production speed.
<br>If you want to donate something for the project, you can do so with the following links.
<br>Due to organizational limitations, its only possible to donate to individual members of the project.

- MaschathOS (By Ignatz)
    - Maschath is a made up combination from Maat, Seth and Seshat. For me they represent the following: Sachat is the godess of writing and mathematics on old egypt. Transfered to modern times, for me Seshat is godess of informatics and information. Representing the code i write. Seth is the old egypt god for chaos, and the dessert. I transfered him to be god of chaos, but also creativity and engagement. He represents my adhd side, and my creativity. Maat is the goddes of world order and rights. She represents the balance between chaos and order. The balance between trying to make everything perfect of seschat, and the chaos and creativity of seth.
