<h1>Welcome :-)</h1> 

This is the repository for the Custom Firmware for the SF2000 from DataFrog. 

<h2>Project Status:</h2>
Currently we are in a very early stage. We found the SDK for the chip, and are currently preparing it to build the first booting firmware. There is still A LOT of work to be done.<br> 
<h3>When will it be done?</h3>
Short answer: It will be done, when it's done.<br>
Slightly Longer Answer: At this point it's nearly impossible to say how long this will take. Anywhere from a few months, to a few years I guess.

<h2>FAQ:</h2>

- Do we need funding?
    - No. Check the Donation part of this readme for more details. 
- Does the Firmware have a name? 
    - No, not yet. But we are collecting possible names, and are currently doing a community poll to find the best one. Once the project is mature enough, we will pick the most voted name. (Link to the poll: https://cloud.maschath.de/apps/polls/s/sFak08ki)

<h2>Project Members:</h2>

<b>Ignatz:</b> Maintainer of this repository, main dev on the SF2000 Custom Firmware and Project Manager. Has ADHD, so might be unreliable at times, but always has the best intent.
<br><b>Osaka:</b> A researcher of the original firmware, author of the bootloader fix and the sample custom code (BMP viewer).
<br><b>xTxNinjaZx AKA Kev:</b> Researcher/tester of the current firmware on the SF2000 and Custom Firmware Dev support. Has OCD which can be a blessing and a curse, you decide. Also, a father and a husband so only working on this when he can :-)

<h2>Support:</h2>

If you want to help on the project, please contact Ignatz on the Retro Handheld Discord in the data_frog_sf2000/SF2000 Dev Channel, he is the current maintainer of the project. You can also check the Issues board for the current progress and open tickets. But please sync with Ignatz first before starting on something so we can avoid that something might be done out of order or double. Which would just waste effort.

<h2>Donations:</h2>

Please note that donations are not a guarantee for the project to continue, or to succeed. If you decide to donate anyway, we will be very grateful about that.<br>
We also don't need any funding at the moment. We have the tools we need to work, we just need time. So Anything you might donate will be just out of kindness, and might heighten the spirit of the devs, but it will not increase production speed.
<br>If you want to donate something for the project, you can do so with the following links.
<br>Due to organizational limitations, it's only possible to donate to individual members of the project.

    - kero - is the sound frog makes in Japanese
- MaschathOS (By Ignatz)
    - Maschath is a made up combination from Maat, Seth and Seshat. For me they represent the following: Sachat is the goddess of writing and mathematics in old Egypt. Transferred to modern times, for me Seshat is goddess of informatics and information. Representing the code I write. Seth is the old Egypt god for chaos, and the dessert. I transferred him to be god of chaos, but also creativity and engagement. He represents my adhd side, and my creativity. Maat is the goddess of world order and rights. She represents the balance between chaos and order. The balance between trying to make everything perfect of Seshat, and the chaos and creativity of Seth.
